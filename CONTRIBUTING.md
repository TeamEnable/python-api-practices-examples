# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this repository.

This project accompanies the book **Python API Practices — Vol. 1** and focuses on
clear, production-minded examples rather than feature completeness.

Contributions are welcome, but the bar is intentionally high.

## What this repository is (and is not)

**This repository is:**
- A collection of small, readable examples
- Focused on structure, boundaries, and habits
- Optimized for learning and discussion

**This repository is not:**
- A framework or starter template
- A place for clever abstractions
- A showcase of every possible feature

If a change makes the examples harder to reason about, it will likely be rejected.

## Types of contributions welcome

- Fixes for bugs or incorrect behavior
- Improvements to clarity or readability
- Corrections to examples that don’t match the book
- Small, focused enhancements that reduce confusion

Before proposing larger changes, please open an issue to discuss intent.

## Contribution guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused
- Prefer boring, explicit code over clever code
- Follow existing structure and naming conventions
- Add or update tests when behavior changes
- Ensure examples still run offline by default

Consistency matters more than completeness.

## Development setup

Each example track is self-contained and uses **UV** for dependency management.

Refer to the README in each subdirectory (`fastapi/`, `djangodrf/`) for
setup and run instructions.

## Review process

This repository is currently maintained by a single author.

- Not all contributions may be accepted
- Feedback may focus on *why* something does not fit
- Rejections are not personal — they protect consistency

Accepted contributors will be credited in future releases.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive.
Disagreements are fine; disrespect is not.

Thank you for helping improve the quality of these examples.
